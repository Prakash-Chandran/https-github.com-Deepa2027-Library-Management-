NAME: PRAKASH C
REG NO: 212223240122
```
## Aim :
To create UML Diagrams for Library management system using StarUML.


## PROBLEM STATEMENT: 
To create Library Management System software that will meet the needs of the 
applicat and help them to registering and buy the book for the Library, modification in 
database and cancellation for the registered project. 


           
## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: 

       Rational Rose 
       SQL 8.0 
       
## HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS:

       1.512MB RAM 
       2.Pentium III Processor
       
## USE CASE DIAGRAM
A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify, and 
organize system requirements. The use case is made up of a set of possible sequences 
of interactions between systems and users in a particular environment and related to a 
particular goal. It is represented using ellipse. Actor is any external entity that makes 
use of the system being modeled.

## ACTIVITY DIAGRAM
An activity diagram is a variation or special case of a state machine in 
which the states or activity representing the performance of operation and transitions 
are triggered by the completion of operation. The purpose is to provide view of close and 
what is going on inside a use case or among several classes. An activity is shown as 
rounded box containing the name of operation

## CLASS DIAGRAM
A class is drawn as rectangle box with three compartments or components 
separated by horizontal lines. The top compartment holds the class name and middle 
compartment holds the attribute and bottom compartment holds list of operations.

## COMMUNICATION DIAGRAM
A collaboration diagram is similar to sequence diagram but the message in 
number format. In a collaboration diagram sequence diagram is indicated by the 
numbering the message. A collaboration diagram, also called a communication 
diagram or interaction diagram, A sophisticated modeling tool can easily convert a 
collaboration diagram into a sequence diagram and the vice versa. A collaboration 
diagram resembles a flowchart that portrays the roles, functionality and behavior of 
individual objects as well as the overall operation of the system in real time.

## PACKAGE DIAGRAM

A package diagram is represented as a folder shown as a large rectangle with a 
top attached to its upper left corner. A package may contain both sub ordinate package 
and ordinary model elements. All uml models and diagrams are organized into package. 
A package diagram in unified modeling language that depicts the dependencies 
between the packages that make up a model. A Package Diagram (PD) shows a grouping 
of elements in the OO model, and is a Cradle extension to UML PDs can be used to 
show groups of classes in Class Diagrams (CDs), groups of components or processes in 
Component Diagrams (CPDs), or groups of processors in Deployment Diagrams (DPDs). 
There are three types of layer. They are 
1.User interface layer 
2.Domain layer 
3.Technical services layer

## SEQUENCE DIAGRAM
A sequence diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a kind of 
interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what order.

## RESULT
The UML Diagrams for Library management system have been successfully created and implemented using StarUML.
